# parse-keystrokes
Parsing my keystroke data for statistics about which keys I use the most.

You will need to use the keylogger created at (https://github.com/caseyscarborough/keylogger)[https://github.com/caseyscarborough/keylogger].

Then you can edit configuration.yml and run parser.py to generate the statistics.
